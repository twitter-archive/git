NAME
----
git-interpret-trailers - help add stuctured information into commit messages

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git interpret-trailers' [--trim-empty] [(<token>[(=|:)<value>])...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Help add RFC 822-like headers, called 'trailers', at the end of the
otherwise free-form part of a commit message.

This command is a filter. It reads the standard input for a commit
message and applies the `token` arguments, if any, to this
message. The resulting message is emited on the standard output.

Some configuration variables control the way the `token` arguments are
applied to the message and the way any existing trailer in the message
is changed. They also make it possible to automatically add some
trailers.

By default, a 'token=value' or 'token:value' argument will be added
only if no trailer with the same (token, value) pair is already in the
message. The 'token' and 'value' parts will be trimmed to remove
starting and trailing whitespace, and the resulting trimmed 'token'
and 'value' will appear in the message like this:

------------------------------------------------
token: value
------------------------------------------------

By default, if there are already trailers with the same 'token', the
new trailer will appear just after the last trailer with the same
'token'. Otherwise it will appear at the end of the message.

Note that 'trailers' do not follow and are not intended to follow many
rules that are in RFC 822. For example they do not follow the line
breaking rules, the encoding rules and probably many other rules.

OPTIONS
-------
--trim-empty::
	If the 'value' part of any trailer contains only whitespace,
	the whole trailer will be removed from the resulting message.

CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
-----------------------

trailer.<token>.key::
	This 'key' will be used instead of 'token' in the
	trailer. After some alphanumeric characters, it can contain
	some non alphanumeric characters like ':', '=' or '#' that will
	be used instead of ':' to separate the token from the value in
	the trailer, though the default ':' is more standard.

trailer.<token>.where::
	This can be either `after`, which is the default, or
	`before`. If it is `before`, then a trailer with the specified
	token, will appear before, instead of after, other trailers
	with the same token, or otherwise at the beginning, instead of
	at the end, of all the trailers.

trailer.<token>.ifexist::
	This option makes it possible to choose what action will be
	performed when there is already at least one trailer with the
	same token in the message.
+
The valid values for this option are: `addIfDifferent` (this is the
default), `addIfDifferentNeighbor`, `add`, `overwrite` or `doNothing`.
+
With `addIfDifferent`, a new trailer will be added only if no trailer
with the same (token, value) pair is already in the message.
+
With `addIfDifferentNeighbor`, a new trailer will be added only if no
trailer with the same (token, value) pair is above or below the line
where the new trailer will be added.
+
With `add`, a new trailer will be added, even if some trailers with
the same (token, value) pair are already in the message.
+
With `overwrite`, the new trailer will overwrite an existing trailer
with the same token.
+
With `doNothing`, nothing will be done, that is no new trailer will be
added if there is already one with the same token in the message.

trailer.<token>.ifmissing::
	This option makes it possible to choose what action will be
	performed when there is not yet any trailer with the same
	token in the message.
+
The valid values for this option are: `add` (this is the default) and
`doNothing`.
+
With `add`, a new trailer will be added.
+
With `doNothing`, nothing will be done.

trailer.<token>.command::
	This option can be used to specify a shell command that will
	be used to automatically add or modify a trailer with the
	specified 'token'.
+
When this option is specified, it is like if a special 'token=value'
argument is added at the end of the command line, where 'value' will
be given by the standard output of the specified command.
+
If the command contains the `$ARG` string, this string will be
replaced with the 'value' part of an existing trailer with the same
token, if any, before the command is launched.
